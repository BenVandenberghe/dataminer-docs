# Swarming

With the upcoming DataMiner Swarming functionality, you will be able to [switch objects](xref:SwitchingObjects), such as elements or services, from one DataMiner Agent to another Agent in that cluster.

The primary goal of Swarming is to eliminate downtime resulting from maintenance activities, to recover from failures in the underlying compute infrastructure, and provide a more polished user experience for system administrators.

> [!NOTE]
> Swarming is not available in DataMiner Systems with a [storage per DMA setup](xref:Configuring_storage_per_DMA) (Cassandra or MySQL).

> [!TIP]
> As Swarming is **scheduled for production in Q4 of 2024**, and it will already become available in soft launch before this, we are working on adding more information to this section. Check back for updates frequently!
